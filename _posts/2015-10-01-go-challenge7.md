The 7th Go Challenge author is Francesc Campoy Flores who joined the Go team in 2012 as Developer Advocate after several years as a Python and C++ developer. His mission is to make Go useful and fun.

Francesc has this to say about the challenge:

> "Preparing this challenge got me so excited about the support for OpenGL and simple audio primitives that I had to concentrate on writing the description rather than hacking on my own virtual piano.

> Event based applications are easily modeled using goroutines and channels, and I expect this project will be a chance for everyone to experiment with them."

#### The Go Challenge 7

##### A piano on your phone

##### Preamble

The latest version of Go 1.5 released last month includes, among many other cool things, experimental support for mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.

I have personally played around with the the golang.org/x/mobile packages and thought this challenge would be a great opportunity to see what great projects people could come up.


**Goals of the challenge**

The goal is simple: build a virtual piano for mobile devices.

The piano should display a set of keys (some white, some black) as in real traditional pianos (see image below). When the user presses a key a sound should be played. How and what exactly the key sounds is left to your choice and artistic freedom.

**Requirements of the challenge**

The resulting application should:

* run on Android (at least),
* uses the [golang.org/x/mobile/gl](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/gl) to display a set of keys,
* use the [golang.org/x/mobile/exp/audio](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/exp/audio) package to generate sounds
* have some way for the user to act on what sound is generated

**Bonus features**:

* use complex interactions other than simple taps
* allow the user to save/export the music generated
* create a web page where users can show their skills
* provide a way for different musicians to colaborate/compete

**Hints**

There's multiple ways to generate audio. You can use audio files quite easily, but it would be much more creative to provide a way to generate sounds "from scratch" with [https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/exp/audio/al](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/exp/audio/al).
